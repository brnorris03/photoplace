But, you have to release your changes as free software too ;-). The project was born inspired by Noela to easily create KMZ layers to use in <a href="http://kartenn.es" rel="nofollow">Kartenn</a>, and was developed by Jos√©.

As well, we would really appreciate it if you would consider making a <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=N6XRW9DLPFSRN" rel="nofollow">small donation</a>: half of the money will be donated to a local NGO <a href="http://gaiadiaadia.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Ecodesarrollo Gaia</a> which helps people in Africa, with the other half, I would like to visit Australia and, in connection with a geotagging program, my antipodes in New Zeland, and your coins can help us to achieve those goals.
