1   Install pyexiv2 (formed python-pyexiv2) version 0.2 
    (recommended version is 0.2.2) but the latest available version is 0.3 is ok.
    Since pyexiv2 0.2/0.3 is not in the official repostiories of Ubuntu/Debian 
    you must download it from https://launchpad.net/~pyexiv2-developers/+archive/ppa/+packages
    and type (for example):
        $dpkg -i python-pyexiv2_0.3.0-0ubuntu1ppa1~maverick1_i386.deb

2)  Install PIL (Python Image Library) version 1.1.7 or superior.
    Since it is in ubuntu repositories, just type
    $ sudo apt-get install python-imaging

3)  Install pyGTK
    $ sudo apt-get install python-gtk2
