Description: A tool for geotagging your photos and ... much more!
 It is a multiplatform program to easily geotag your photos as well as 
 generating a Google Earth/Maps layer with your photos and a track log 
 from a GPS device. Moreover, the program can be easily adapted by editing 
 templates and its functionality can be complemented with plugins, for 
 example there is a plugin to generate a music tour that can be used to 
 present your photo collection.
