What is PhotoPlace?
===================

It is a multiplatform program (tested on Linux and Windows platforms) 
developed with python 2.x (>= 2.6) to easily geotag your photos. 

Also, with a track log from a GPS device, it can generate a *Google Earth*
/*Maps* layer with your photos. Moreover, the program can be easily adapted 
by editing templates and its functionality can be complemented with plugins, 
for example there is a plugin to generate a music tour that can be used 
to present your photo collection.

The authors and developers hope you like this program. We would really 
appreciate it if you would consider making a small donation: half of the 
money will be donated to a local NGO *Ecodesarrollo Gaia* 
(http://gaiadiaadia.blogspot.com) that helps people in Senegal (Africa), 
with the other half, I would like to visit Australia and,  in connection 
with a geotagging  program, my antipodes in New Zeland, and your coins 
can help me to achieve this goals.
