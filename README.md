What is [PhotoPlace](http://www.photoplace.io)?
===============================================

It is a multiplatform program (tested on Linux and Windows platforms) 
developed with python 2.x (>= 2.6) to easily geotag your photos. 

Also, with a track log from a GPS device, it can generate a *Google Earth*
/*Maps* layer with your photos. Moreover, the program can be easily adapted 
by editing templates and its functionality can be complemented with plugins, 
for example there is a plugin to generate a music tour that can be used 
to present your photo collection.

with the other half, we would like to visit Australia and,  in connection
with a geotagging  program, my antipodes in New Zeland, and your coins
